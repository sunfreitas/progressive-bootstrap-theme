It's a modern and free [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) responsive template created under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The **Progressive Bootstrap Theme** includes the most common UI elements used in current web development, being a good getting started to understand how to do some trick with HTML5 and CSS3 like aminations and fake image filters.
